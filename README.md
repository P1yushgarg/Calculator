# Calculator Application

A modern web-based calculator application with both basic and scientific modes, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🌟 Features

### Basic Calculator
- Standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Percentage calculations
- Decimal point support
- Parentheses for complex expressions
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Colorful, intuitive UI with color-coded operators

### Scientific Calculator
- All basic calculator functions
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
- Mathematical constants (π, e)
- Square root (√)
- Power/exponent operations (x^y)
- Factorial (x!)
- Reciprocal (1/x)
- Angle calculations (degrees to radians conversion)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- No additional dependencies required

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/P1yushgarg/Calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Calculator
```

3. Open `Calculator1.html` in your web browser to start using the application.

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Calculator
1. From the home page, click on "BASIC CALCULATOR"
2. Click number buttons to input values
3. Click operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform operations
4. Press "=" to calculate the result
5. Use "C" to clear the display
6. Use "⌦" (backspace) to delete the last character

### Scientific Calculator
1. From the home page, click on "SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR"
2. Enter numbers and use advanced functions:
   - Trigonometric: sin, cos, tan (angles in degrees)
   - Logarithmic: log (base 10), ln (natural log)
   - Special: √ (square root), x^y (power), x! (factorial)
   - Constants: π (pi), e (Euler's number)
3. Press "=" to calculate the result

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Gradient Background**: Beautiful blue gradient for a modern look
- **Color-Coded Operators**:
  - Red: Multiplication (*)
  - Orange: Addition (+)
  - Green: Division (/)
  - Blue: Subtraction (-)
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive button animations on hover
- **Navigation Bar**: Easy switching between Home, Basic, and Scientific calculators
- **Responsive Display**: Clear, large display for better readability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
